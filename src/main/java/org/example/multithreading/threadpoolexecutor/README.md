### 🔹 Example Usage (All Parameters)

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class FullThreadPoolExecutorExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ThreadFactory customThreadFactory = r -> {
            Thread t = new Thread(r);
            t.setName("Custom-Thread");
            return t;
        };

        RejectedExecutionHandler customHandler = new ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy();

        ThreadPoolExecutor executor = new ThreadPoolExecutor(
                2,                             // core pool size
                4,                             // max pool size
                10,                            // keep-alive time
                TimeUnit.SECONDS,              // time unit
                new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(2),   // bounded work queue

            executor.submit(() -> {
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " executing task " + taskId);
                try { Thread.sleep(1000); } catch (InterruptedException ignored) {}
            });
        }

        executor.shutdown();

```
| Step | Task | What Happens?                                  |
| ---- | ---- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | 1    | Assigned to Core Thread 1                      |
| 2    | 2    | Assigned to Core Thread 2                      |
| 3    | 3    | Added to Queue                                 |
| 4    | 4    | Added to Queue                                 |
| 5    | 5    | New thread created (since max is 4)            |
| 6    | 6    | New thread created                             |
| 7    | 7    | Queue full, max threads running → **Rejected** |
| 8    | 8    | **Rejected**                                   |
| 9    | 9    | **Rejected**                                   |
| 10   | 10   | **Rejected**                                   |

---

### ✅ Common `RejectedExecutionHandler` Policies:

* `AbortPolicy` → Throws `RejectedExecutionException` (default).
* `CallerRunsPolicy` → Runs task in calling thread.
* `DiscardPolicy` → Silently discards the task.
* `DiscardOldestPolicy` → Discards oldest unhandled task in queue.

---

### ✅ `allowCoreThreadTimeOut` in `ThreadPoolExecutor`

By **default**, **core threads live forever** even if they are idle.

When you call:

```java
executor.allowCoreThreadTimeOut(true);
```

👉 You **allow core threads to terminate** if they stay idle **longer than the keep-alive time.**

---

## 🔹 Why It’s Useful?

* Helps **release core threads** in low-load situations.
* Reduces resource consumption.

---

## 🔹 Example:

```java
ThreadPoolExecutor executor = new ThreadPoolExecutor(
        2, 4, 5, TimeUnit.SECONDS,
        new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(2)
);

// By default, core threads won't time out.
// Enable timeout for core threads.
executor.allowCoreThreadTimeOut(true);
```

### 🔥 Effect:

* If **a core thread stays idle > 5 seconds**, it will be removed.
* Thread pool can shrink to **zero threads** if idle.

---

## 🔹 Without `allowCoreThreadTimeOut(true)`

* Core threads stay alive **indefinitely**, even when idle.

---

## ✅ Quick Summary:

| Property              | Default     | With allowCoreThreadTimeOut(true) |
| --------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------- |
| Core thread timeout   | ❌ Disabled  | ✅ Enabled                         |
| Minimum threads alive | Always core | Can shrink to zero                |
| Resource efficiency   | Lower       | Higher                            |


---

## ✅ Key Methods to Inspect the Pool:

| Method                    | Description                              |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `getQueue()`              | Returns the task queue.                  |
| `getActiveCount()`        | Number of currently running threads.     |
| `getPoolSize()`           | Current number of threads in the pool.   |
| `getLargestPoolSize()`    | Peak number of threads ever in the pool. |
| `getTaskCount()`          | Total number of tasks scheduled.         |
| `getCompletedTaskCount()` | Number of tasks completed so far.        |

---

## 🔥 Example to Monitor Queue:

```java
System.out.println("Current Queue: " + executor.getQueue());
System.out.println("Active Threads: " + executor.getActiveCount());
System.out.println("Pool Size: " + executor.getPoolSize());
System.out.println("Completed Tasks: " + executor.getCompletedTaskCount());
```

---

## ✅ If You Want to See Pending Tasks:

```java
BlockingQueue<Runnable> queue = executor.getQueue();
System.out.println("Pending Tasks in Queue: " + queue.size());
queue.forEach(task -> System.out.println("Queued Task: " + task));
```

---

### 🔹 Notes:

* `getQueue()` gives you the **live reference** of the queue.
* You can see **queued (waiting) tasks**, but not directly see which thread is executing which task (unless you add custom tracking logs).

---

This is a **classic interview question** to test whether you understand **thread pool sizing** based on system capacity and workload characteristics.

Here’s a solid, precise answer:

---

## ✅ Why Core Pool Size = 2? (Example Reasoning)

> "I chose a core pool size of **2** in this example for demonstration purposes to intentionally trigger queuing and rejection scenarios so that I can observe the behavior of the thread pool, queue management, and rejection handlers in action.

However, in real-world scenarios, the core pool size should be based on the nature of the tasks and the system's hardware."

---

## 🔥 Real-World Sizing Logic:

### For **CPU-bound tasks**:

* Threads should not exceed the number of CPU cores.
* Formula:

```text
Core Pool Size ≈ Number of CPU Cores
```

* Example: `Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors()`

---

### For **I/O-bound tasks**:

* Threads can exceed the number of CPU cores because threads often wait (on disk, network, etc.).
* Formula:

```text
Core Pool Size ≈ Number of CPU Cores * (1 + I/O Wait Time / Compute Time)
```

* Example: If CPU has 4 cores and threads wait a lot → Core pool size can be much larger.

---

## ✅ Summary Answer for Interview:

> "The core pool size should be selected based on **task type and system resources.**
> For **CPU-bound** tasks, I would align it closely with the number of CPU cores to avoid context switching overhead.
> For **I/O-bound** tasks, I would choose a higher number to maximize throughput since threads frequently wait.
> In this specific example, I intentionally chose 2 to demonstrate thread expansion, queueing, and rejection behaviors clearly."

---
Let’s break this down in a super **simple, step-by-step** way:

---

# ✅ CPU-bound Tasks

### 🔹 What are they?

* Tasks that mostly **use the CPU to do calculations** (like math, sorting, etc.).
* Example: Calculating Fibonacci numbers, image processing, video encoding.

### 🔹 Why limit threads here?

* **CPU can only run one thread per core at a time.**
* If you create more threads than CPU cores:

    * Threads will fight for CPU time.
    * CPU keeps switching between them → slows everything down.

### 🔹 Rule:

👉 **Core Pool Size ≈ Number of CPU Cores**

* If your system has 4 cores → You should have around **4 threads.**

### 🔹 How to get CPU cores in Java?

```java
int cores = Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors();
```

---

# ✅ I/O-bound Tasks

### 🔹 What are they?

* Tasks that **wait a lot** (like waiting for disk reads, database responses, API calls).
* Example: Downloading files, calling web services, reading files from disk.

### 🔹 Why can you have more threads here?

* When one thread is **waiting (blocked)**, the CPU is free to run other threads.
* Example: Out of 10 threads, maybe only 2 are actively using the CPU → so you can safely have **many more threads than CPU cores.**

---

### 🔹 Formula:

```text
Core Pool Size ≈ Number of CPU Cores * (1 + (I/O Wait Time ÷ CPU Time))
```

👉 **What does this mean?**

* If a thread spends more time waiting than working → you can create more threads.

### 🔹 Example:

Let’s say:

* I/O Wait Time = 8 seconds
* CPU Compute Time = 2 seconds

So:

```text
Core Pool Size ≈ 4 * (1 + 8/2) = 4 * (1 + 4) = 4 * 5 = 20 threads
```

This means → you can safely create **around 20 threads** because most of them will be waiting, not using the CPU.

---

### ✅ Final Summary:

| Task Type | Threads Count                                         |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| CPU-bound | Close to CPU cores (4 cores → 4 threads)              |
| I/O-bound | Can have many more threads (calculated using formula) |

Here’s a **detailed list of important methods** for both `Future` and `CompletableFuture` in Java:

# ✅ Future Methods (Blocking, Java 5)

| Method                         | Purpose                                    |
