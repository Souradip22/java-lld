# Observer Design Pattern

## Introduction

The Observer Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a one-to-many dependency between objects. When the state of one object changes, all its dependents (observers) are notified and updated automatically. This pattern promotes loose coupling between the subject (the object being observed) and its observers, allowing for greater flexibility and maintainability in the design.

## Participants

- **Subject**: Represents the object being observed. It maintains a list of observers and provides methods to add, remove, and notify observers.
- **Observer**: Defines an interface for objects that should be notified of changes in the subject's state.
- **ConcreteSubject**: Implements the Subject interface. It is responsible for maintaining the state of the subject and notifying observers of any changes.
- **ConcreteObserver**: Implements the Observer interface. It defines the behavior to be executed when notified of changes in the subject's state.

## Motivation

Use the Observer Design Pattern in the following scenarios:
- When you have a one-to-many dependency between objects, and changes to one object should automatically trigger updates in other objects.
- When you want to decouple the subject from its observers, allowing for greater flexibility and reusability in the code.
- When you need to allow observers to subscribe and unsubscribe dynamically at runtime.

## Example

Consider a stock market application where various investors are interested in receiving updates about the price of a particular stock. In this scenario:
- The **Stock** class represents the subject, which maintains the price of the stock and notifies investors of any changes.
- The **Investor** class represents the observer, which receives updates about the stock's price and reacts accordingly.

## Implementation

- Define interfaces for the Subject and Observer to ensure loose coupling between the subject and its observers.
- Implement concrete classes for the Subject and Observer, providing methods for adding, removing, and notifying observers.
- Ensure that observers are properly added and removed from the subject to avoid memory leaks and unwanted updates.
- Consider using Java's built-in observer interfaces (`java.util.Observer` and `java.util.Observable`) or implementing custom interfaces based on your requirements.

## Benefits

- **Loose Coupling**: Observers are loosely coupled with the subject, allowing for greater flexibility and maintainability in the code.
- **Separation of Concerns**: The Observer Design Pattern separates the core component (subject) from its dependents (observers), promoting a clean and modular design.
- **Dynamic Relationship**: Observers can be added or removed at runtime, allowing for dynamic changes in the relationship between the subject and its observers.

## Drawbacks

- **Unwanted Updates**: Observers may receive unnecessary updates if the subject's state changes frequently or if not properly managed.
- **Memory Leaks**: Care must be taken to properly remove observers when they are no longer needed to avoid memory leaks.

## Related Patterns

- **Publish-Subscribe Pattern**: A variant of the Observer Design Pattern where subscribers subscribe to topics of interest and receive notifications when events related to those topics occur.
- **Mediator Pattern**: Promotes loose coupling between components by centralizing communication between them through a mediator object.
